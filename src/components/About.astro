             <p>
							 I love portrait photography and minimalism. For me, it’s not
							just about creating a beautiful photo — trust, openness to the process, and
							genuine emotions are just as important.
						</p>
						<p>
							I’ve been passionate about creativity since childhood and have always loved
							observing people. Photography combines everything I love: fashion, beauty,
							and art. I follow trends and use them to highlight each person’s
							individuality.
						</p>
						<p>
							For me, every photoshoot is a creative space and a form of therapy, where we
							can explore self-love together.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you like my work — it means we’ve found each other. See you soon!
